# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## User Story 

> As an **concert promoter**, <br> 
> I want to **analyze attendance for Taylor Swiftâ€™s concerts and ticket sales data**, <br> 
> so that I can **optimize future concert bookings and marketing strategies**.
