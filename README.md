# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## User Story 

> As an **concert promoter**, <br> 
> I want to **analyze attendance for Taylor Swiftâ€™s concerts and ticket sales data**, <br> 
> so that I can **optimize future concert bookings and marketing strategies**.

## Description 

This project creates a data analysis program for a concert promoter who wants to improve attendance and ticket sales for Taylor Swift's concerts. It uses a dataset from Kaggle that includes information about venues, tickets sold, tickets available, and revenue. Users can interact with the program through a simple console interface using the Scanner class. They can choose options to find out the revenue for specific venues, total tickets sold, average revenue per venue, or view all concert information. This program helps the promoter make better decisions based on past data, ultimately improving marketing strategies and future concert bookings.
